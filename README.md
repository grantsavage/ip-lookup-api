```
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e PORT="3000" -e AUTH_USERNAME="secureworks" AUTH_PASSWORD="supersecret" iplookup:1.0
```
Optionally add the `-it` flag to view the container logs.

```
PORT="3000" AUTH_USERNAME="secureworks" AUTH_PASSWORD="supersecret" ./server

### GraphQL Endpoint

```
Now use the generated token and set it as the `Authorization` header like so:
``` 
Authorization: Basic <your token here>
```

### Enqueue

```
query {
    getIPDetails(ip: "1.2.3.4") {
        uuid
        ip_address
        response_code
        created_at
